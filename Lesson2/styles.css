/* Selectors are used to apply styles to certain HTML elements */
/* 
- HTML elements - body, p, ul, ol, form, a, div, etc.
- Class (used in most cases, used to select multiple elements) - .className (className is the name that you create yourself)
- ID (must be unique) - #nameOfId
- pseudo-class - a:hover (:nameOfPseudeClassSelector), you must use one of already defined selectors in CSS
- pseudo-element - ::first-line (::nameOfPseudeClassSelector), you must use one of already defined selectors in CSS
*/

/* Precedence
From the least important to the most important
- external stylesheet
- <style> tag in HTML document
- Inline styles
- !important 

1. Do not mix different types of adding CSS (usualy, an external CSS file is used)
2. Do not use "!important" unless it's absolutely necessary
